**Snap Shine** 
Snap Shine is a dual-function desk lamp designed with dorm life in mind. Created for ME170: Computer-Aided Design, this product solves a common problem faced by studentsâ€”how to work at night without disturbing roommates with harsh overhead lighting.
Snap Shine features a detachable lamp head that transforms into a handheld flashlight, allowing users to move freely and complete tasks discreetly. Whether you're studying late, grabbing something from across the room, or navigating a dark dorm, Snap Shine offers flexibility and comfort in shared living spaces.

**Design & Development**
This project was developed in a small team with a focus on both practicality and manufacturability. Each week, we applied new concepts from class to refine our design:
- Injection molding principles for scalable production
- Engineering drawings and dimensioning for precise communication
- Cost analysis using aPriori to validate business feasibility
We emphasized iterative design, peer collaboration, and real-world constraints to ensure Snap Shine could be realistically produced and marketed.
